# Windows Server 2016 Home Lab

From small businesses to large enterprises, virtually every organization uses the Windows Server operating system and its Active Directory and Exchange Server services for centralized management of authentication, email, policies, and more. Windows Server 2016 specifically (and its associated Exchange Server 2016) is still one of the most used versions of the operating system, which means this lab translates directly to office environments today. 

## Technologies Used

- PowerShell
- Windows Server 2016
- Active Directory Domain Services
- Exchange Server 2016

## Walk-through

Google _**Windows Server 2016 evaluation download**_. The first or second result should look something like this: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2016. Next to _**English (United States)**_, select _**64-bit edition**_ to download the ISO file. 

Next, you can [burn the ISO to a disc](https://www.wikihow.com/Burn-ISO-Files-to-DVD), create a [bootable USB flash drive](https://rufus.ie/en/), or create a virtual machine in your favorite hypervisorâ€”I recommend at least 2 GB of RAM, two processor cores, and 50 GB of disk space for a long-term home lab project that will contain an increasing amount of files. 

Boot your machine from the installation media:
